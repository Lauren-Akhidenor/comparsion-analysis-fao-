## Project Overview
This project presents a **comparative analysis of inflation, producer price changes, and agricultural production trends** (2019–2025) across selected countries using **FAOSTAT data**.  

The focus is on **potatoes and wheat**, evaluating how macroeconomic pressures translate into producer returns and consumer costs across **developed and developing economies**, including Nigeria, Egypt, Jordan, Kenya, Ireland, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

## Data Source
- **Source:** FAOSTAT (UN Food and Agriculture Organization)  
- **Dataset:** Food Prices and Agricultural Producer Statistics  
- **Period:** 2019 - 2025  

**Key Variables:**
- **Inflation Rate (YoY %):** Consumer-level inflation  
- **Cumulative Inflation Since 2018 (%):** Long-term inflationary trend  
- **Producer Price Change (YoY %):** Annual change in farm-gate prices  
- **Producer Production ($):** Agricultural output value (Potatoes and Wheat)

### Comparative Overview of Agricultural Performance
![Screenshot 992](Screenshot%20(992).png)

- **Map:** Geographic coverage (Africa, Europe, North America)  
- **KPI Card:** Average producer price (e.g., $963.56)  
- **Bar Chart:** Producer production values ($) by country  
  - USA and UK lead in potato and wheat output  
  - Nigeria and Kenya show lower producer returns, indicating income disparities  
- **Data Table:** Production totals by crop and country

### Inflation and Producer Price Trends (2019–2025)
![Screenshot 993](Screenshot%20(993).png)

- **Consumer Price Inflation (YoY %):** Household-level price fluctuations  
  - Nigeria and Egypt experience spikes (2021–2024)  
  - European countries remain stable  
- **Producer Price Change (YoY %):** Farm-gate price trends  
  - Jordan and Kenya show moderate growth  
  - Nigeria lags despite high consumer inflation  
- **Cumulative Inflation:** Highlights pressure since 2018  
- **Production Trends:** Wheat remains relatively stable; potato production is more volatile  

**Analytical Insight:** Consumer inflation does not necessarily translate to higher producer earnings, reflecting **price transmission gaps** and **food affordability challenges**.

---

## Rationale for Crop Selection
- **Potatoes and Wheat** represent staple crops in developed and developing economies  
- Illustrate **disparities in price transmission** between consumer and producer levels  
- Highlight smallholder **vulnerability to global inflation and market shocks**  
- Serve as a lens to inform **policy interventions and development strategies**

## Country Group Comparison

| Country Group                        | Inflation Pattern         | Producer Impact                  | Key Challenge                     |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Nigeria, Egypt                        | High spikes (2021–24)   | Lags behind consumer prices      | Price transmission failure        |
| Kenya, Jordan                         | Moderate growth         | Some producer gains              | Market inefficiency               |
| USA, UK, Netherlands, Ireland         | Stable, low             | High efficiency maintained       | Sustaining competitiveness        |

## Critical Price Transmission Gap
**The Core Problem:** Consumer inflation does **not** translate to producer gains  

- Farmers in developing countries often do **not benefit** when food prices rise  
- Intermediaries and middlemen capture most of the margin  
- Smallholders remain vulnerable despite **high market prices**  

---

## Strategic Recommendations by Urgency

### Immediate Actions (0–6 months)
- **Exempt agricultural inputs** from import tariffs during inflation spikes  
- **Establish price monitoring** to track consumer-producer gaps  
- **Launch inflation-indexed credit products** for farmers  

### Short-term Actions (6–12 months)
- Implement **minimum support prices** for staple crops (e.g., potatoes, wheat) in Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt  
- **Digitize market information systems** with real-time alerts  
- Publish **quarterly inflation impact assessments**  

### Medium-term Actions (1–3 years)
- Build **strategic grain reserves** to stabilise supply  
- Invest in **post-harvest storage infrastructure**  
- **Transfer productivity practices** from USA/UK systems to improve efficiency in developing countries  

---

## Summary: 
This cross-country comparison demonstrates how **market inefficiencies and price transmission gaps** affect smallholders.  
Adopting **tiered, urgent, and medium-term interventions** can enhance producer welfare, stabilise markets, and support sustainable food systems globally.
