# Comparative Analysis of Inflation and Producer Price Trends between (2019-2025) Across Selected Countries

A Power BI Visualization of FAOSTAT Data with Focus on Potatoes and Wheat Across Selected Countries

---

## Project Overview

This project presents a comparative Power BI analysis of consumer price inflation, producer price changes, and agricultural production trends between 2019 and 2025 using data from **FAOSTAT (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations)**.

The focus is on agriculture, particularly **potatoes and wheat**, two of the world’s most important staple crops. By comparing countries such as **Nigeria, Egypt, Jordan, Kenya, Ireland, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States**, the dashboard highlights how economic pressures translate differently across producers and consumers in both developed and developing agricultural economies.

## Data Source

**FAOSTAT (UN Food and Agriculture Organization)**  
**Dataset:** Food Price and Agricultural Producer Statistics  
**Period:** 2019–2025  

**Variables Analyzed:**
- **Inflation Rate (YoY %)**: Consumer-level inflation
- **Inflation Since 2018 (%)**: Long-term inflation trend
- **Producer Price Change (YoY %)**: Annual change in agricultural producer prices
- **Producer Production ($)**: Value of agricultural output (Potatoes and Wheat)

- **Map Visualization:** Displays regions analyzed (Africa, Europe, North America)
- **KPI Card:** Shows the average producer price across all countries (e.g., $963.56)
- **Bar Chart:** Compares producer production values ($) across selected countries
  - USA and UK record the highest production values for potatoes and wheat
  - Nigeria and Kenya reflect lower producer returns, highlighting income disparity
- **Data Table:** Lists total production by country and crop type
  - Potatoes dominate in developed nations
  - Wheat remains key in both developed and developing economies





  
### Inflation and Producer Price Trends (2019–2025)




  ![Screenshot 993](Screenshot%20(993).png)





- **Consumer Price Inflation (YoY %):** Shows household price fluctuations
  - Nigeria and Egypt face sharp inflation spikes (2021–2024)
  - European economies maintain relative stability
- **Producer Price Change (YoY %):** Shows farm-gate price evolution
  - Jordan and Kenya moderate growth
  - Nigeria lags despite high consumer inflation
- **Inflation Since 2018 (%):** Visualizes cumulative inflationary pressure
- **Production Trend Chart:** Wheat maintains stability; potato production fluctuates with market shocks

**Insight:** Highlights the gap between consumer inflation and producer returns, key to understanding food affordability and farmer welfare.

## Why Agriculture and Why Potatoes & Wheat?

Agriculture is central to **economic stability** and **human welfare**. Potatoes and wheat were chosen because they reflect:
- The contrast between staple crop systems in developed and developing regions
- The **price transmission gap**  where inflation felt by consumers doesn’t always translate to higher earnings for producers
- Farmers’ vulnerability to global inflationary trends and production shocks

This analysis translates FAOSTAT data into actionable insights reflecting macro-level inflation dynamics and micro-level agricultural realities.

## 💡 Key Insights

- Inflation doesn’t affect all equally consumers face rising costs, producer gains vary widely
- Potato-producing economies (USA, UK) maintain high production efficiency and lower volatility
- Wheat-producing developing nations (Nigeria, Kenya) experience larger inflation shocks relative to output growth
- The **gap between consumer and producer prices** highlights economic imbalance within the agricultural supply chain
