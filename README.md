## Project Overview
This project presents a **comparative analysis of inflation, producer price changes, and agricultural production trends** (2019–2025) across selected countries using **FAOSTAT data**.  

The focus is on **potatoes and wheat**, evaluating how macroeconomic pressures translate into producer returns and consumer costs across **developed and developing economies**, including Nigeria, Egypt, Jordan, Kenya, Ireland, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

## Data Source
- **Source:** FAOSTAT (UN Food and Agriculture Organization)  
- **Dataset:** Food Prices and Agricultural Producer Statistics  
- **Period:** 2019–2025  

**Key Variables:**
- **Inflation Rate (YoY %):** Consumer-level inflation  
- **Cumulative Inflation Since 2018 (%):** Long-term inflationary trend  
- **Producer Price Change (YoY %):** Annual change in farm-gate prices  
- **Producer Production ($):** Agricultural output value (Potatoes and Wheat)

### Comparative Overview of Agricultural Performance
![Screenshot 992](Screenshot%20(992).png)

- **Map:** Geographic coverage (Africa, Europe, North America)  
- **KPI Card:** Average producer price (e.g., $963.56)  
- **Bar Chart:** Producer production values ($) by country  
  - USA and UK lead in potato and wheat output  
  - Nigeria and Kenya show lower producer returns, indicating income disparities  
- **Data Table:** Production totals by crop and country

### Inflation and Producer Price Trends (2019–2025)
![Screenshot 993](Screenshot%20(993).png)

- **Consumer Price Inflation (YoY %):** Household-level price fluctuations  
  - Nigeria and Egypt experience spikes (2021–2024)  
  - European countries remain stable  
- **Producer Price Change (YoY %):** Farm-gate price trends  
  - Jordan and Kenya show moderate growth  
  - Nigeria lags despite high consumer inflation  
- **Cumulative Inflation:** Highlights pressure since 2018  
- **Production Trends:** Wheat remains relatively stable; potato production is more volatile  

**Analytical Insight:** Consumer inflation does not necessarily translate to higher producer earnings, reflecting **price transmission gaps** and **food affordability challenges**.

---

## Rationale for Crop Selection
- **Potatoes and Wheat** represent staple crops in developed and developing economies  
- Illustrate **disparities in price transmission** between consumer and producer levels  
- Highlight smallholder **vulnerability to global inflation and market shocks**  
- Serve as a lens to inform **policy interventions and development strategies**  

---

## Key Insights
- Inflation affects consumers and producers differently; gains are uneven across economies  
- Developed nations (USA, UK) maintain **high efficiency and lower volatility** in potato production  
- Developing countries (Nigeria, Kenya) face **larger inflationary shocks** relative to output growth  
- The **gap between consumer and producer prices** emphasises economic imbalance in agricultural value chains  

---

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning, modelling, and visualisation in **Power BI**  
- **Time-series and comparative economic analysis**  
- Interpretation of agricultural and inflationary data for **policy and development insights**  
- Dashboard design for **decision-making and reporting**
